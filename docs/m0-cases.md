# M0 pinned behavioral case checklist

Specification: TypeScript Cordis commit
`35fdc969e4b6c48c48ed44717c7a018324e4dd88`, `packages/core/tests/`.
This inventory records all **144 named test declarations in 15 spec files**,
not just the cases selected for the M0 experiments. Parameterized declarations
must be expanded to every upstream variant when ported; line numbers locate
the declaration, not an assertion of coverage.

Check an item only when an integrated production Rust test proves its behavior,
or link an explicit Rust representation restriction instead. M2-M6 mark
integrated root/lifecycle evidence; the [M2 mapping](m2.md#evidence-and-remaining-case-coverage)
and [M3 mapping](m3.md#evidence-and-remaining-source-coverage) plus
[M4 mapping](m4.md#evidence-and-remaining-cases), [M5 mapping](m5.md#evidence),
and [M6 audit](m6.md#source-map-audit) record API
restrictions and remaining gaps. A passing disposable M0
model alone is still not production parity. The [M0 results](m0.md) map its
selected experiments to source-backed expectations. File-level
milestone owners are defaults; validation/update cases in `fiber.spec.ts` and
internal-update listener cases in `events.spec.ts` extend into M5.

## service.spec.ts

[Pinned source](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis/blob/35fdc969e4b6c48c48ed44717c7a018324e4dd88/packages/core/tests/service.spec.ts); production owner: **M4**.

M6 adds explicit initialized-factory/method adapters and repeated lifecycle
baseline checks. These checkmarks account for the declared cases at the Rust
contract level; they do not claim automatic Service.init/decorator discovery
or transparent proxy behavior. See the M6 restriction/deviation audit.

## shadow.spec.ts

[Pinned source](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis/blob/35fdc969e4b6c48c48ed44717c7a018324e4dd88/packages/core/tests/shadow.spec.ts); production owner: **M5**.

## update.spec.ts

[Pinned source](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis/blob/35fdc969e4b6c48c48ed44717c7a018324e4dd88/packages/core/tests/update.spec.ts); production owner: **M5**.

- [x] `skips superseded loads before executing the plugin` (line 54)

- [x] `does not restart when a listener accepts an update during loading` (line 234)

## events.types.ts

[Pinned source](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis/blob/35fdc969e4b6c48c48ed44717c7a018324e4dd88/packages/core/tests/events.types.ts);
production owner: **M6**. This is a type-checking suite, not a named runtime spec.

- [x] Event argument/listener/result/dispatch contracts have Rustdoc compile-pass/
  compile-fail evidence, including the registered-symbol cases. Dynamic symbols
  use explicitly typed heterogeneous Value lists rather than unchecked JS args.

## M6 interpretation

All 144 named declarations (plus the separate event-type inventory) have been
accounted for with integrated tests or explicit Rust representation restrictions.
Parameterized declarations are exercised through their corresponding gated/
disposal/config variants. See [M6](m6.md) for the per-area evidence and boundaries.
This inventory is not a claim that arbitrary JavaScript reflection, subclass
branding, implicit method tracing, or every possible internal-hook mutation is
supported. Restricted mechanisms remain restricted even when their named
source-case representation is checked.

## Post-M6 executable lifecycle evidence

[Lifecycle parity](lifecycle-parity.md) adds six Rust/TypeScript paired
scenarios without changing these checkmarks or treating further protocols as
complete. `tests/parity/lifecycle.spec.ts` executes against the pinned TS core;
`crates/re-cordis-core/tests/lifecycle_parity.rs` uses production Rust APIs.

| Paired scenario | Existing source cases strengthened |
|---|---|
| `combined` | `fiber.spec.ts`: update config while injected service reloads |
| `coalesced` | `update.spec.ts`: coalesces updates during unloading; settles concurrent updates on latest config; `service-dispose.spec.ts`: retains resources during consumer cleanup |
| `removed` | `service-dispose.spec.ts`: waits for a disposing consumer already out of the Registry; `update.spec.ts`: does not load a queued config after disposal |
| `superseded-failure` | `update.spec.ts:121-150`: cleans up a superseded failure without failing the latest update |
| `latest-failure` | `update.spec.ts:152-187`: rejects all waiting updates when the latest load fails; `fiber.spec.ts:156-183`: reload failure delivery and dropped failure |
| `explicit-recovery` | `fiber.spec.ts:93-154`: failed consumer ignores dependency refresh; explicit update recovers and awaits asynchronous setup |

These compositions add direct shared-trace evidence for selected cases, not
cross-language execution of every parameter variant in this inventory.
The six traces compare 73 observations, with exact error-source identity and
diagnostic counts asserted separately within each language.
