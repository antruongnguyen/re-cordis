## What this project is

`re-cordis` is a from-scratch Rust reimplementation of the
[Cordis](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis) meta-framework.

**Status: M0-M6 Rust core delivery and acceptance implemented.**
The completed post-M6 lifecycle-parity slices add six executed Rust/TypeScript
scenarios (152 Rust integration tests, 17 Rustdoc checks), including bounded
failure/recovery evidence. See `docs/lifecycle-parity.md` for reproduction and
evidence boundaries.
The approved first-consumer scope is implemented: snapshot digest, bounded `gh`
collector and signed loopback webhook journal (12 additional application tests
on Unix). See `docs/github-activity.md`. Application dependencies are dev-only.
The selected next-target order is timer, console logger, then loader, followed
by assessment of other satellites. The **`re-cordis-timer`** satellite is
delivered (unpublished `crates/re-cordis-timer`: owner-scoped timeout, sleep,
interval/stream, throttle and debounce over core effects, via a sealed
`TimerExt` trait; the `tokio` `time`/`macros` features live in the timer crate,
not the core; 15 deterministic tests over a paused clock). The console logger
and loader are not implemented yet. See `docs/todo.md` for source review,
per-slice design gates and documentation acceptance, and
`docs/superpowers/specs`/`docs/superpowers/plans` for the timer design and plan.
The root Rust 2024 workspace contains the unpublished `crates/re-cordis-core`
and `crates/re-cordis-timer` (Rust 1.85 minimum). Use `cargo test --workspace`.
Acceptance, logging, examples and compatibility restrictions are in `docs/m6.md`.
Isolation/bound-call/update contracts are in `docs/m5.md`;
publication/access/dependency-retention contracts are in `docs/m4.md`;
Plugin/Registry/scoped-resource contracts are in `docs/m3.md`, with effects,
events, and diagnostics in `docs/m2.md`. This is an explicit Rust API, not
transparent JavaScript Proxy/decorator compatibility. The isolated `spikes/m0`
package remains research evidence; run it with its own `--manifest-path`.

## Source of truth

The **TypeScript `cordis`** project is the specification. When behavior is
ambiguous or two references disagree, the TS implementation wins.

Two reference checkouts live under `local/` (git-ignored, cloned locally):

- `local/cordis` — the original TypeScript Cordis. **This is the spec.**
  Core concepts live in `local/cordis/packages/core/src/`.
- `local/cordis-rs` — an independent prior Rust port
  ([dshbox/cordis-rs](https://github.com/dshbox/cordis-rs)). **Reference only.**
  Useful for seeing how others solved a problem in Rust; it is not a target and
  may diverge from upstream. Do not treat its decisions as authoritative.

We mirror the *semantics* of TS Cordis, not its mechanisms. The original relies
on JavaScript-only features (Proxy-based reflection, prototype-chain
inheritance, callable objects) that have no direct Rust equivalent. See
`docs/limitation.md`.

## Keep the docs current

This repository front-loads documentation. Whenever you make a meaningful
change, update the relevant doc in the same change:

- `README.md` — project front door: intent, concept map, planned layout.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — notable changes (Keep a Changelog style).
- `docs/todo.md` — the porting roadmap.
- `docs/decision.md` — decisions made and why.
- `docs/limitation.md` — known gaps and unresolved tensions.
- `docs/en/` and `docs/vi/` — matching current user guides and API reference.
- `docs/llms.txt` — concise AI-agent reading paths and framework constraints.

Run `python3 -B tests/docs/test_check.py` and the documentation checker for
explicit stable/1.85.0 toolchains after guide/API changes; see `docs/README.md`.
Its current export/snippet checks target core and need extension when a
satellite is delivered.

## Tooling conventions

- After implementing and verifying each milestone, commit its code and related
  documentation on the current branch. Do not push unless explicitly requested.
- Never include a `Co-authored-by` trailer in git commit messages.
- Use `rg` (ripgrep) instead of `grep` for searching.
- If a `.codegraph/` directory appears at the repo root, prefer CodeGraph
  (`codegraph explore ...`) over grep/find for understanding code. Indexing is
  the maintainer's decision — do not run it unprompted.

These conventions are intentionally lean and will grow as the project does.
